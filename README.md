# Jester Joke Rating Prediction Using Classical ML

## Project Abstract

This machine learning project employs classical ML techniques to predict user ratings for jokes from the Jester Joke Dataset. By analyzing joke content, the project aims to not only predict ratings but also identify popular jokes.

## Introduction

This project delves into computational humor modeling, leveraging the Jester Joke Dataset's 100 jokes rated by users. The goal is to construct a model using classical ML techniques that can effectively predict user ratings and guide in recommending popular jokes.

## Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, feature extraction, and creating quantitative representations of humor.
- ML Techniques: Employs a blend of classical ML algorithms, focusing on ensemble model with SVR and Linear Regression for robust prediction.

## Data Analysis

- User Engagement Insights: Analysis of joke ratings and user engagement patterns.
- Correlation Studies: Exploration of relationships between joke characteristics and user ratings.

## Result
Used a seperate validation set of 100 jokes
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.5694062720920148
- R-squared (R²): 0.2187492248355496
